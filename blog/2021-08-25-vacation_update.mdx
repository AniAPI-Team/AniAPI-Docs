Unfortunately vacations have ended.

As AniAPI's founder and main developer, I started working on new things and features.
In the next months you will see (for sure):

* The MyAnimeList external synchronization
* An initial API administration system
* More details on episodes throught AniDB

For every step included inside the roadmap, please refer [to this page](https://github.com/AniAPI-Team/AniAPI/projects/4).

In addition, say "hello" to a brand new wrapper written in **Javascript**: [AniAPI-Wrapper](https://github.com/MattPlays/AniAPI-Wrapper) by [MattPlays](https://github.com/MattPlays)!

Let me say so many thanks to you, MattPlays. I hope someone skilled in JS will start using AniAPI for his project throught your wrapper :)

So... we will meet again in a narrow future,

Dazorn96
