Hi all!

I am **Marco** aka **Dazorn96** and I am here to let you all know something more about newer **API version**.

As some of you know, we were working on a more complex and reliable version of **AniAPI** during last year since now.
Now, I can confirm that we are close to releasing it!

In order to give you a little preview on what has been done... the new version main features:
* increased anime pool, to grant a larger covering
* added support for anime openings and endings
* added an internal user system to sync with main external trackers (**AniList** for example)
* handled an automatic synchronization for status and progress with trackers
* and more...

As this post title is saying, please keep in touch with the blog to know when the new version will be released.

See you on the next update,

Dazorn96
