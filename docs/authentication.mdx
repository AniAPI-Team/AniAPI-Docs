# Authentication

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

AniAPI uses **[JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction)** to authenticate requests. 
Each JWT is referred to an user `id` and is valid for `30` days.
When a JWT expire, the user should login again to obtain a new one.

You can obtain your JWT on **[your profile page](../profile#jwt)**.

Authentication on secured endpoints is managed with **HTTP Bearer Auth**, which expect the use of `Authorization` HTTP header:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="curl"
    values={[
        { label: 'cURL', value: 'curl' },
        { label: 'JS', value: 'js' }
    ]}>
<TabItem value="curl">

  ```bash
    curl -i https://api.aniapi.com/v1/user_story -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT>"
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js">

  ```js
    fetch('https://api.aniapi.com/v1/user_story', {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_JWT>',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Accept': 'application/json'
      }
    });
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Validation

Since **JWTs** have an expiration time, you will have to validate your **JWT** before making requests to the **API**.
Therefore you will need to make a validation request to `https://api.aniapi.com/v1/auth/me` in order to find out if your **JWT** is still usable.

```bash title="Example request"
curl -i https://api.aniapi.com/v1/auth/me -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT>"
```

If your **JWT** is valid you will get a response like below:

```js title="Example response"
{
    "status_code": 200,
    "message": "Hi Dazorn",
    "data": {
        "username": "Dazorn",
        "id": 1,
        //...
    },
    "version": "1"
}
```

## OAuth

AniAPI gives the possibility to access protected endpoints from **third-party apps**.

You can view and manage all your clients on **[the developer page](../developer)**, after **[signing in](../login)**.

### Do I need to use OAuth?

If you want to allow users to login with their **AniAPI acccount** and have complete access on their data **you will need** to use OAuth.
Otherwise, if your application scope is **read-only** on public data, you won't need it.

### Which grant type should I use?

It depends on the environment where your app is running:
* use the **[Implicit grant](oauth/implicit_grant)** if your client is a **website** or a **mobile application**
* use the **[Authorization Code grant](oauth/authorization_code_grant)** if you can securely store your **client's credentials** (for example on a **server**)
