# Authentication

AniAPI uses **[JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction)** to authenticate requests. 
Each JWT is referred to an user `id` and is valid for `30` days.
When a JWT expire, the user should login again to obtain a new one.

You can obtain your JWT on **[your profile page](../profile)**.

Authentication on secured endpoints is managed with **HTTP Bearer Auth**, which expect the use of `Authorization` HTTP header:

```curl
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT>
```

## OAuth

AniAPI gives the possibility to access protected endpoints from **third-party apps**.

You can view and manage all your clients on **[the developer page](../developer)**, after **[signing in](../login)**.

### Do I need to use OAuth?

If you want to allow users to login with their **AniAPI acccount** and have complete access on their data **you will need** to use OAuth.
Otherwise, if your application scope is **read-only** on public data, you won't need it.

### Which grant type should I use?

It depends on the environment where your app is running:
* use the **[Implicit grant](oauth/implicit_grant)** if your client is a **website** or a **mobile application**
* use the **[Authorization Code grant](oauth/authorization_code_grant)** if you can securely store your **client's credentials** (for example on a **server**)
