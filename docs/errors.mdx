# Errors

AniAPI uses conventional **[HTTP response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)** to indicate the success or failure of an API request.
As a summary:

* `2xx` range indicates success
* `4xx` range indicates an error regarding the information provided (e.g., a required parameter missing, a resource not found, etc)
* `5xx` range indicates an error with AniAPI's server

:::caution

HTTP errors are returned inside the **[HTTP response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header)**, instead API errors are returned inside the **HTTP response body**!

## API errors

When an API request gets an HTTP `200` status code as a response, it could mean that the **API response** contains an error.
These are the possible errors you can have:

|  Status                   | Reason                                                                    |
| ---                       | ---                                                                       |
| `200 - OK`                | Everything worked as expected                                             |
| `400 - Bad request`       | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter   |
| `401 - Unauthorized`      | The user is not able to authenticate                                      |
| `403 - Forbidden`         | The user doesn't have permissions to perform the request                  |
| `404 - Not found`         | The requested resource doesn't exist                                      |
| `429 - Too many requests` | Too many requests hit the API too quickly from the same origin            |
| `500 - Server error`      | Something went wrong on AniAPI's end                                      |

## Handling errors

We recommend to focus on HTTP errors just for **[Authentication](authentication)** or **network** problems.
