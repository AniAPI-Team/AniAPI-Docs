# Pagination

All API resources have support for **bulk fetches** via *list* API methods.
These methods share a common structure, which allows three additional parameters:

| Name          | Default   | Description                                                               |
| ---           | ---       | ---                                                                       |
| `locale`      | `en`      | Indicates the resource's desired localization                             |
| `page`        | `1`       | Indicates the list page to fetch                                          |
| `per_page`    | `100`     | Indicates the desired results number on each page (max value is `100`)    |

:::info

## Paginated response

In order to give informations about the returned list of resources, AniAPI also provides **pagination parameters** inside the response's `data` field:

* `current_page`, which tells you the current page number
* `count`, indicating the number of total documents satisfying the filter
* `documents`, an array containing the current page documents
* `last_page`, to indicate the last page available to fetch

```js title="Example paginated response"
{
    "status_code": 200,
    "message": "Page 1 contains 100 anime. Last page number is 161 for a total of 16094 anime",
    "data": {
        "current_page": 1,
        "count": 16094,
        "documents": [
            {
                // ...
            },
            {
                // ...
            },
            // ...
        ],
        "last_page": 161
    }
}
```
