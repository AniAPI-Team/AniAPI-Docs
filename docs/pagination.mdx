# Pagination

All API resources have support for **bulk fetches** via *list* API methods.
These methods share a common structure, which allows six additional parameters:

| Name              | Default   | Description                                                                                       |
| ---               | ---       | ---                                                                                               |
| `locale`          | `en`      | Indicates the resource's desired localization                                                     |
| `page`            | `1`       | Indicates the list page to fetch                                                                  |
| `per_page`        | `100`     | Indicates the desired results number on each page (max value is `100`)                            |
| `ids`             | `[]`      | An array filter you can apply on the `id` field of results                                        |
| `sort_fields`     | `[]`      | An array of fields to apply a specific sort on the results                                        |
| `sort_directions` | `[]`      | An array of integers (`1` or `-1`) to specify the sort direction on each field in `sort_fields`   |

:::info

Actually `locale` parameter is used on few resource types

:::

:::caution

When sorting, if you did not provide a `direction` for a `field`, **AniAPI** will use `1` as default

:::

## Resources structure

Every *Resource* of **AniAPI** comes with a default set of fields:

| Name              | Description                           |
| ---               | ---                                   |
| `creation_date`   | The document's creation datetime      |
| `update_date`     | The document's last update datetime   |

:::caution

These fields are not returned from API fetches.
Them are just used for sorting's scopes.

:::

## Paginated response

In order to give informations about the returned list of resources, AniAPI also provides **pagination parameters** inside the response's `data` field:

* `current_page`, which tells you the current page number
* `count`, indicating the number of total documents satisfying the filter
* `documents`, an array containing the current page documents
* `last_page`, to indicate the last page available to fetch

```js title="Example paginated response"
{
    "status_code": 200,
    "message": "Page 1 contains 100 anime. Last page number is 161 for a total of 16094 anime",
    "data": {
        "current_page": 1,
        "count": 16094,
        "documents": [
            {
                // ...
            },
            {
                // ...
            },
            // ...
        ],
        "last_page": 161
    }
}
```
