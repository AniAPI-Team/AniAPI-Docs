# Rate Limiting

As AniAPI is free-to-use, we wanna be sure to avoid too many requests on a limited span of time.
Therefore, request from the same origin are limited to `90` per **minute**.

Inside each **HTTP response header** from the API, you will receive three additional **headers**:

* `X-RateLimit-Limit`, which indicates the **maximum requests number** you can do in a minute
* `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, to update you on your **current remaining number of requests** 
* `X-RateLimit-Reset`, which tells you about **how many seconds you have to wait** until you can make another **accepted request**

:::tip

You have to care about `X-RateLimit-Reset` only if you do more than `90` requests in a minute

:::

When you go over `90` requests in a minute, you will get a `429` **HTTP error** as response.
