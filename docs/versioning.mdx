# Versioning

As AniAPI could change in future times, we use a versioning system to upgrade and mantain it.
Each API request must provide the wanted API version inside the **[URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL)**:

```http title="Example request for v1 AniAPI"
https://api.aniapi.com/v1/anime
```

Latest (and current) version available is **v1** API.

Stay in touch with our **[Patreon](https://patreon.com/aniapi)** to know when a newer version will be released.
